# Task Activities

## Functionality available within the Task Panel

Clicking a status icon on a task tile in the main form leads to the task panel, where you can find and set details about work periods.

![Task Tile](./media/task-activities/task-tile.png)

### Set up time tile

This tile represents set-up time – a period needed to prepare a Resource before starting production. Planned, actual, and booked set-up duration is displayed. Click the icon on the tile to set the start and end times of the set-up time. 2. Run time tile.

### Run time tile

This tile represents run time – a work period on a specific Resource. Click the icon on the tile to set the start and end times of the run time. Planned, actual, and booked run duration is displayed. The reported quantity is also shown. 3. Downtime tile.

### Downtime tile

This tile represents downtime – a period of a break in work brought on by accident, e.g., a power cut. Click the icon on the tile to set the start and end time of the downtime. Click [here](./downtime.md) to find out more.

Click the thumb-up icon to confirm and perform it again in the panel on the right. A message In Progress. Issue from Production will be displayed.

Receipt from production has to be confirmed from SAP B1 level by going to Production → Inventory Transactions → Pick Receipts. Pick the required document, click the right mouse button, and choose Receipt from production.

Check also the [Quick Receipt](../customization/optional-functions/quick-receipt.md) option.

### Team Log in

![Assign Task](./media/task-activities/assign-task.png)

A team leader can choose Employees that are to be assigned to the task. There is no limit for Employees to be assigned to one task.

:::caution
Please note that Employee has to have [Labour](../../administrator-guide/setting-up-the-application/setting-up-the-application.md#setting-up-the-application) assigned to be able to be chosen from the list.
:::

Click checkboxes next to required Employees and click an arrow left icon to assign them to a Task.

Next to each of the Employees, there is an icon indicating if an Employee is currently assigned to any Task (a man icon) or not (the sleep icon). Click the icon to display a list of Tasks to which an Employee is assigned.

The option also supports Teams (a standard SAP Business One option that can be set up in Human Resources > Employee Master Data > Membership tab). Each Team is represented by a header containing a Team name (1 and 2 in the example screenshot above). You can display or hide a list of members (up/down icon next to a Team name). A Header also contains a percentage value: it is a percentage of people in the team without any Task assigned.

Click the OK icon after choosing all required Employees (by moving them to the Assigned section).

After choosing Employees by the team leader and accepting the choice, the Task will be set to Run status for every Employee assigned.

Finishing work by a team leader finishes it for every Employee assigned. The Team leader sets up the produced quantity on a Resource on finishing work.

One Time Booking document is created for a Resource and Employees specified on it (instead of creating a Time Booking for each Employee).

Click here<!-- TODO: Link --> to find out more about related ProcessForce options.

Each Employee can finish work independently, e.g. to change Resources or leave work station. Finishing work by Employee does not finish it for others. An employee does not declare quantity on finishing work.

### Activity

This is a standard SAP Business One functionality. You can set up an activity (e.g. Conversation, Note) and activity type (e.g. General, Internal) in [ProcessForce General Settings](../../administrator-guide/setting-up-the-application/setting-up-the-application.md#processforce-settings). When choosing the Activity option from the CompuTec PDC level an Activity with predefined settings are created. This way, an activity is connected to a specific Manufacturing Order, Operation, Resource (depends on from which Task tile it is created), and Employee (logged in to CompuTec PDC).

### Technical Instruction

Here you can find instructions stored in Manufacturing Order → Operations → Instruction tab.

:::info Path
Production → Manufacturing Order → Manufacturing Order
:::

![Manufacturing Order Instructions](./media/task-activities/manufacturing-order-instructions.png)

### Additional options

Some of the available options are not present on a Task Tile by default. You can reach them by using the [Customization](../customization/optional-functions/optional-functions.md) option.

## Example

In this section, you can find a step-by-step guide on setting work time on a task based on a specific example.

### Adding a new task

To get information on this, click [here](../adding-new-task.md).

### Click a status icon on a task tile to open a task panel of a specific task.

![Example New Task](./media/task-activities/example-new-task.png)

### Setting set-up time

a. click the set-up icon on the set-up time tile. You can predefine whether clicking starts counting time from a current moment or leads to setting up the start date and time manually panel (the Show Date Picker option).

b. the set-up time starts to count. It will be communicated by the set-up time and period turning green, the period changing in real-time, and by the set-up icon on the set-up tile blue highlight.

![Example Setting Up Time](./media/task-activities/example-setting-up-time.png)

c. click the set-up icon again to end the set-up time. It may be done after logging out and logging in again. It will cause a stop of time counting which will be communicated by the set-up time and period turning blue.

![Example Set Up Time Stop](./media/task-activities/example-set-up-time-stop.png)

:::caution
Clicking the status icon on a task tile displays (or hide if it is displayed) a log of actions performed on a current task in the CompuTec PDC application. You can delete an activity by clicking the X icon next to it.
:::

![Example Set Up Time Entry](./media/task-activities/example-set-up-time-entry.png)

### Setting run time

Run time setting must be performed the same way setting set-up time was – only using the run time tile.

Set-up time ends automatically after starting a run time.

If the Confirmation button is clicked before setting the end of run time, a communication will be displayed:

![Example Message](./media/task-activities/example-message.png)

Click the yes button to set the run time's end which leads to Confirmation Panel or the no button to cancel the action.

### Setting downtime

Click [here](./downtime.md) to find out more.

### Confirmation of time periods in a task

:::warning
All changes in periods are set in the CompuTec PDC application. Changes are posted in a chosen database only after posting a document from the Confirmation panel.
:::

1. After setting all the periods, click the "complete" icon: ![Complete Icon](./media/task-activities/complete-icon.png)

The Confirmation Panel will appear:

![Confirmation Panel](./media/task-activities/confirmation-panel.png)

You can register quantity for set up time (if it is needed; this option is available only when set up time has been registered) and quantity for run time (number of Items produced during work time). When the Damaged Quantity field is filled, the Reason Code and Remarks for rework fields will be displayed and ready to fill:

![Wrong Quantity](./media/task-activities/wrong-quantity.png)

2. After setting up quantities you can decide to keep the task open after registering work (no check boxes checked), to close the task or to pass it to another employee Select Employee field will be displayed in this case.

![Final Option](./media/task-activities/final-options.png)

**Close Task** – checking this option causes the following:

- a task with this option checked is removed from the list of tasks to do – and gets Closed status on a Gantt chart,

- in Manufacturing Order, Operation tab, the Resource line is grayed out and a value in the Resource column Active is set to N,

- a Resource for an Operation on which Close Task is used is not available to choose for a new task on CompuTec PDC.

When all of the Resources in an Operation have Active set to N, the Operation gets Finished status.

Unblocking a Resource for operation in the Manufacturing Order scope can be done by adding a Timebooking correction document with an unchecked Close Task option.

**Pass to other** – this option adds the task to a specified employee. After accepting the task, it is passed to the chosen employee. It has to be started manually from the chosen employee level.

**Pass to other Resource** – this option allows to pass a Task to another Resource on registering a Timebooking or downtime. On choosing this option a drop-down list appears with Alternative Resources defined for a current Resource (it is possible to switch the Task only to an Alternative Resource with Machine Type for a current Resource. Click here to find out more about Alternative Resources definition in ProcessForce).

To be able to pass a Task to another Resource it is required to check Is enabled Move to Other Resource in Employee Master Data.

Click the confirmation icon to register work.

3. Number of Resources – in this field, we can define a number of resources of the same kind for which work is to be recorded, e.g. if we have a Resource called Oven, here we can define how many pieces of the same equipment was used, e.g. 5 ovens. By default 1 is put in this field. In case of putting a higher value, recorded duration is the accumulated effort of each of the equipment pieces.

#### Example:

We recorded 48h, and 25s of work and set up the Number of Resources to 5. The effort is multiplied by 5 (work was performed on 5 pieces of equipment simultaneously) which results in 240h, 2m, 5s of accumulated work duration.

![Time Bookings Multiple Resources](./media/task-activities/time-bookings-multiple-resources.png)

:::info Path
Please mind that the Number of Resources field value is set up to 1 by default, regardless of the Number of Resources field value of a corresponding Resource record in ProcessForce.
:::

### Recording quantity without closing a Task.

You can use the plus icon to record quantity without closing a Task: ![Record Quantity Icon](./media/task-activities/record-quantity-icon.jpg)

This leads to a panel similar to Confirmation Panel in which it is possible to enter required quantities. Doing so updates Reported Quantity on Task Panel. A Task is still open and active after doing so.
