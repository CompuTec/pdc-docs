# Customized Task List

This function allows creating a customized table view when adding a task by Resource. This means that based on a few mandatory fields, it is possible to give information from other objects in SAP Business One or ProcessForce by creating an SQL code.

To create a view, perform the following steps:

## Create an SQL code (what columns you would like to display on what conditions, order, etc)

Rules:

- The code has to have a condition written like `where mor16."U_RscCode" =@RscCode`

- The code has to be based on CT_PF tables like `OMOR and/or MOR12 and/or MOR16`

- Columns' aliases need to be written with a floor like `1THWORD_2THWORD`

- `"DocEntry"` and `mor16."U_LineNum"` are always obligatory

Example:

```SQL
select

omor."DocEntry"

,mor16."U_LineNum"

,omor."DocNum" as "_Nr_dokumentu"

,omor."U_ItemCode" as "_Kod_indeksu"

,omor."U_Description" as "_Nazwa_indeksu"

,omor."U_Quantity" as "_Planowana_ilośc"

,omor."U_PlannedStartDate" "_Planowana_data_rozpoczęcia"

,mor12."U_OprCode" as "_Kod_operacji"

,opr."U_OprName" as "_Nazwa_operacji"

,mor14."U_ItemCode" as "_Kod_materiału"

,oitm."ItemName" as "_Nazwa_materiału"

from

"@CT_PF_OMOR" omor

inner join "@CT_PF_MOR12" mor12 on omor."DocEntry"=mor12."DocEntry"

inner join "@CT_PF_MOR16" mor16 on omor."DocEntry"=mor16."DocEntry" and mor12."U_RtgOprCode"=mor16."U_RtgOprCode"

left join "@CT_PF_MOR14" mor14 on mor12."DocEntry" = mor14."DocEntry" and mor12."U_RtgOprCode"=mor14."U_RtgOprCode"

inner join "@CT_PF_OOPR" opr on mor12."U_OprCode"=opr."U_OprCode"

left join "OITM" oitm on mor14."U_ItemCode"=oitm."ItemCode"

where mor16."U_RscCode" =@RscCode

and omor."DocNum" like '21%'

and mor16."U_Active"='Y'

and omor."U_Status" in ('ST','RL')
```

## Query Manager

The code needs to be saved in **Query Manager**:

![Query Manager](./media/customized-task-list/query-manager.png)

## PDC Settings

It is needed to create a PDC Setting view and select created view/query in the **Task List** field.

![Task List](./media/customized-task-list/task-list.png)

## Employee Master Data

The last step to use the customized task list is to assign the created PDC Setting to Employee at Employee Master Data window:

![Employee Master Data](./media/customized-task-list/employee-master-data.png)

Example of the result in CompuTec PDC:
