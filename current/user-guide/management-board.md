# Management Board

Management Board is a CompuTec PDC function that allows managing work performed on any resource in a system. A straightforward graphic interface provides an easy and quick insight into past, current, and planned tasks, stating details like planned and actual work time or employee assigned to perform a specific work.

:::warning
    To have access to the Management Board function, a specific privilege must be assigned to an operating employee. You can check how to do that [below](#setting-management-board-privilege).

### Grouping

To use this option, click the Settings button next to the grouping button (marked by the red frame on the screen above). The following form will appear:

After choosing a required value, records will be divided into groups. In the example below, records are separated by status (in this situation: Downtime and inactive tasks).

![Grouped](./media/management-board/management-board-grouped.webp)

You can use an icon highlighted in the screenshot below to maximize and minimize a group window.

![Rolled](./media/management-board/management-board-grouped-rolled.webp)

Tasks can be grouped by:

- Manufacturing Order,
- Employee,
- Resource Group,
- Status.

## Resource Tile

A task tile within Management Board is a graphic representation of a specific task. You have instant, real-time access to any information connected to a particular task with the possibility to modify it.

![Resource Tile](./media/management-board/management-board-resource-tile.webp)

1. Status icon – icon communicates one of the possible statuses of the task: set up, run, downtime. Clicking it leads to a Task Panel of a specific task. You can find more information about it here.
2. Resource history – clicking it displays the history of use of the specific resource.

    ![Resource History](./media/management-board/management-board-resource-history.webp)

    Document Status:

    ![Finished and Closed Task Icon](./media/management-board/finished-closed-task-icon.webp) - finished and closed task,

    ![Active Task Icon](./media/management-board/active-task-icon.webp) - task currently active,

    ![Planned Task Icon](./media/management-board/planned-task-icon.webp) - planned task. It is possible to assign an employee to a task with this status. To do that, click the icon and choose an employee from the list.

    ![Resource History](./media/management-board/resource-history-employee.webp)
3. Time graph – a graphic representation of planned and current time:

    ![Management Board Graph](./media/management-board/management-board-graph.webp)

    1. a point of 0% progress, e.g., noon in planned 12:00-14:00 work time,
    2. a point of 100% progress, e.g., 14:00 in planned 12:00-14:00 work time,
    3. a bar of real progress,
    4. a bar of planned progress.

    **Example**:

    An example used on a picture above a bar of planned progress indicates that the end of the scheduled work period has already passed. But a bar of real progress shows that work has stopped halfway through.
4. Resource code.
5. Resource name.
