# Overview

Here you can find information on PDC Settings: what details can be defined and how to assign a set of settings to a specific employee or CompuTec PDC installation.

---

## General Settings

You can define the settings to be taken from CompuTec PDC installation (assign just to it) or predefined settings templates (assign to a specific Employee) [CompuTec PDC installation](../overview.md) (assign just to it), or from predefined settings templates (assign to a particular Employee). The way of getting the settings can be set up in [ProcessForce settings](../overview.md#processforce-settings) (PDC Way of Getting Settings field).

## PDC Settings templates

:::info Path
    Administration → Setup → General → PDC Settings

![PDC Settings](./media/pdc-settings/pdc-settings-general.webp)

Here you can define and save a set of settings that can next be assigned to a specific Employee or a specific installation of CompuTec PDC. Go to the next section to check how to do this.

Most of the options are available either in [ProcessForce](../overview.md#processforce-settings) or [PDC-level](../overview.md) level settings.

Options present only in the PDC Settings form:

- Resource Code – if this field is filled in, the user with these PDC Settings assigned can only see Tasks for a specified resource.
- Notification after login – text put in this box is displayed after logging in to the application in an additional form.
- Show Date Picker – this option allows to set amount of time in minutes (e.g., 67 minutes) instead of date and time on time registration:

  ![Show Date Picker](./media/pdc-settings/show-date-picker.webp)
- Localizations – weighting module-related option. Only devices from localizations listed here are available in [Weighting Wizard](../../weight-scales-integration/working-with-scales.md) (the weighting device, along with its localization, can be configured in [CompuTec Gateway Manager](../../weight-scales-integration/computec-gateway-manager.md)). If this field is left empty, all of the devices are available.
- Resources view – click [here](./resource-view.md) to find out more.
- Delay of closing dialogs (s) – here, you can set the time (in seconds) of dialog windows being displayed.
