PDC is now available to work with AppEngine. For details of configuration, please follow this link: CompuTec PDC Plugin. <!-- TODO: Link -->

Wondering why to configure PDC with AppEngine? Below are the strengths of this solution:

- standard benefits from registering work time on PDC,
- more speed and makes the work-time record more effective,
- more straightforward upgrade of the application (no need anymore to upgrade every single terminal - just do it on the server with AppEngine).
