                ```

                ![Prompt](./media/requirements/net-version-prompt.webp)

    We recommend installing the latest version of .NET Framework â€“ you can do it using the dedicated tool Windows Update or manually downloading the required files from the Microsoft site.

## Steps required to perform before installation of CompuTec PDC

1. Install AppEngine, the CompuTec ProcessForce plugin, and the CompuTec PDC plugin in corresponding versions. <!-- TODO: Links -->

2. Install SAP Crystal Reports runtime engine for .NET Framework 32-bit or 64-bit. You can install it from SAP Business One installation package -> `Client\CRRuntime or Client.x64\CRRuntime`. It is required if the user wants to open Crystal Reports directly from the application.

3. Install CompuTec ProcessForce API 32-bit or 64-bit.

## 2.10.20.1: Crystal Reports

From this version, CompuTec PDC supports the new Crystal Reports mechanism. You can find more information [here](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_BUSINESS_ONE_VERSION_FOR_SAP_HANA/686100cb1bc34346b2bc6642685bab43/b1bbebd32ff940c786c76315a8dfa270.html).

Since this version, you need to perform the following preparation to support Crystal Reports:

- Installed SAP APIGateway Service in SLD configuration:

  ![SLD configuration](./media/requirements/sld-configuration.webp)
- define an address in CompuTec PDC Settings. <!-- TODO: Link -->

  ![SAP B1 API Gateway](./media/requirements/pdc-settings.webp)

## CompuTec Labels

If you use CompuTec Labels along with CompuTec PDC, there is a need to have a connection between the CompuTec PDC terminal and a server where CompuTec Labels are installed.
