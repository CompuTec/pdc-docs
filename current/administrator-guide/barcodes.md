# Barcodes

Many of CompuTec PDC functions can be operated by scanning barcodes. Here you can find information on barcode scanning.

## General information

### Barcodes physical attributes

The minimal and maximal size of supported barcodes depends on scanner attributes.

CompuTec PDC supports every barcode standard as long as it is recognizable for a scanner used with the application.

### USB scanners

The CompuTec PDC client can be used with USB scanners. Here is a default configuration:

- scanning device adds a start text sign (Ctrl + B),
- scanning device adds an end text sign (Ctrl + C).

You can set up custom prefixes, suffixes, and group separators here.

## Barcode simulator

PDC Barcode Simulator was created to:

- create barcodes based on the input information,
- print created barcodes,
- simulate barcode scanning in CompuTec PDC (for testing purposes).

Click to download Barcode Simulator.<!--TODO: Link -->

![Barcode Simulator](./media/barcodes/barcode-simulator.webp)

1. A list of elements in a barcode (two prefixes in this example). If you want to generate a barcode without a prefix, leave the Prefix column empty.
2. A list of all input signs:

    - \[STX\] means – CTRL+B
    - \[ETX\] means – CTRL+C
    - \[GroupSeparator\] – a code blocks separator (for codes with more than one prefix)
3. Adding line (for multi-prefix codes).
4. A graphic form of the code generated based on input data.
5. A text form of the code generated based on input data.
6. Click this button to simulate executing the code in CompuTec PDC.
7. Print the generated barcode.
8. Click here to save the code as a file in .webp format.

In PDC Barcode Simulator, you can scan a ready barcode to check its validity and elements (in case it is a multi-prefix code) or to check if the scanning device works correctly.

Check the information in the next section to get to know how to create barcodes for CompuTec PDC and where in the application to use it.

## Barcodes usage in CompuTec PDC

### Logging in form
